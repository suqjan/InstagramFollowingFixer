# InstagramFollowingFixer

Don't you hate it when you look at your profile and see that you follow an abnormal amount of people but your followers doesn't match that number? 

InstagramFollowingFixer fixes that for you. You can see all the people that you follow but they don't follow back. 

InstagramFollowingFixer does not automatically unfollow them all, as this goes against Instagrams API rules. 


For best use, it is sugested that you enable 2FA and use an authenticator app, as it will be needed for log in. 

InstagramFollowingFixer asks you for your username and password, but that is not stored anywhere, and is automatically deleted.
